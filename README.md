This is a fun geology game where you can see what countries use certain energy and minerals.

## Introduction
The user can choose between a multitude of energy and minerals, and it will display a list of the countries that either use that energy the most or harvest the most of that mineral.

## Code
The program will first ask for a mineral or energy source you would like to learn more about. This is what the code looks like:

After typing a mineral or energy source from the list provided, the program will print a top 10 list of the countries that use the most of that energy or that harvest the msot of that mineral. The program will also ask for more input, but all you have to do is type 'E' to exit. Here is an example of what the program will look like:
