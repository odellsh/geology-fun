# geology-fun
This is a fun geology game where you can see what countries use and have certain energy and minerals.

## Introduction
The user can choose between a multitude of energy and minerals, and it will display a list of the countries that either use that energy the most or have the most of that mineral.

## Code
The program will first ask for a mineral or energy source you would like to learn more about. This is what the code looks like:

And this is what the output will look like:

After typing a mineral or energy source from the list provided, the program will print a top 10 list of the countries that use the most of that energy or that have the msot of that mineral. The program will also ask for more input, but all you have to do is type 'E' to exit. Here is an example of what the program will look like:

## FAQ
Q. How updates are these statistics?
A. These statistics are collected from multiple public sources and records from 2020, so very recent!

Q. What if I want to search for a mineral or source that isn't there?
A. Sadly it takes a long time to reasearch and add new minerals, but I will be slowly adding to this game and will update the files right away when completed.

Q. What made you make a game with geology?
A. Great Question! I have taken multiple geology courses, and was always interested in what countries have the most Gold, Silver, etc. I couldn't find a cool website or program that displayed this information so I did it myself, fact-checked by a local professor of course! It is still in it's early stages, but I am excited to add and expand this game!
